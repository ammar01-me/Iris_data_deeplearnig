# Iris Data Analysis

## Installation

To use this project, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Usage

The `iris_data.py` file contains code for analyzing the Iris dataset. The main steps are:

1. Load the Iris dataset using Seaborn.
2. Explore the dataset by printing the first few rows, the shape, and the distribution of species.
3. Create visualizations to understand the relationship between sepal width and species, as well as sepal length and sepal width.
4. Train a Perceptron model to classify the Iris species and evaluate the model's accuracy.
5. Train a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to classify the Iris species and evaluate the model's accuracy.
6. Plot the training and validation accuracy and loss curves for the ANN model.

## API

The `iris_data.py` file does not expose any API. It is a self-contained script for analyzing the Iris dataset.

## Contributing

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open a new issue or submit a pull request on the project's GitHub repository.
